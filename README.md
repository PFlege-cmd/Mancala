# Mancala
Implementation of the game 'Mancala'. Old African Board game for two players.

It starts with 4 stones in each bowl except the Kalaha.

-Players take turns in making a move.

-A move is: pick a bowl that belongs to you, take all its stones
  and distribute them one at a time, anti-clockwise.
  
-While distributing, players include their own Kalaha, but not
  the opponent’s Kalaha.
  
-If a move ends in that player’s Kalaha, he can move again.

-If the last stone is laid in an empty bowl at your own side, the
  player can take that stone and all stones in the opposing bowl
  and put them in your Kalaha.
  
-The game ends when all bowls of the player who has the turn
  are empty (so this player is unable to make a turn)
  
-The winner is the player with the most stones.
